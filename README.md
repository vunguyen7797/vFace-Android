# vFACE: Checking attendance by face recognition

To keep track of the attendance of students, face recognition is the fastest way to identify students with high accuracy based on the class data. This app was made to assist the teacher, professor checking attendance just in few seconds by taking a photo of the whole classroom at the beginning of the class by using the smartphone camera. The app will automatically detect students' faces, identify them by student ID number, and display the list of absence students. There is also a basic attendance statistic feature that calculates the total absences of a student in the semester so that the professor can easily make the decision on a student/s grade if attendance plays an important role in the students' success.
